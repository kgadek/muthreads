buf_size = 1500, make larger?

current code assumes FTP commands are not cut among several TCP reads

* bugs


** SOLVED
telnet send synch (urgent data) causes
Warning: uncaught exception, thread killed! Unix.Unix_error(2, "read", "")
2 = EAGAIN

corrected by enabling trying Unix.read in Muthread readb

why?
version without trying immediately the read:
  - add fd in rfd, put Read _ in readers.

  - check_io does select, fd put in rdo,
    Unix.read performed without enclosing try
    why exception EAGAIN raised there?

the cap shows the two characters are read, the answer is sent
send synch is 0xFF, then 0xF2 as urgent data...

the answer is to the first char 0xFF, the read fails on the second one.

as man 7 tcp says, by default urgent data is not put in the data
stream, so I guess the select says data is available but that's urgent
data so nothing can be read without the MSG_OOB flag to read


** libpam apparently segfaults in native code
for user deleuzec, at second transfer (why ?)
does not segfaults if pam not used...
ok in bytecode

set_user seems ok


** set_user fait planter (freeze) (amd64 ?)
non reproduced
